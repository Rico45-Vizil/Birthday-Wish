No matter how much you argue, you cannot be drawn apart.

She is a joy that cannot be taken away.

Once she enters your life, she is there to stay.


A friend who helps you through difficult times,

Her comforting words are worth much more than dimes.

A partner who fills your life with laughs and smile,

These memories last for miles and miles.


When she is by your side, the world is filled with life.

When she is not around, your days are full of strife.

A sister is a blessing who fills your heart with love.

She flies with you in life with the beauty of a dove.


A companion to whom you can express your feelings,

She doesn't let you get bored at family dealings.

Whether you are having your ups or downs,

She always helps you with a smile and never frowns.


With a sister, you cannot have a grudge.

She is as sweet as chocolate and as smooth as fudge.

Having a sister is not just a trend.

It is knowing you can always turn to her, your best friend.</p>
